This is a certification project for freeCodeCamp.

The txt file has both the HTML and CSS. This will be the last one to have them both the same document.

I'm still pretty new so I have no idea if it's worth the time separting them into different documents but why not.

This one was a doozy because freeCodeCamp can be *very* particular about some things and at the end I spent an excruciating amount of time searching for a spelling mistake :)
